Mining German politicians' tweets


This is an ongoing project on the analyses of some tweets of some German politicians.

In this repository, you will find code and output. Note that *NO* data is made available, as there are legal concerns in sharing Tweets. I plan to make the "hydrated" tweets available (IDs only; the IDs can be re-hydrated using the open Twitter API).
